His walk through the syntax and semantics of JavaScript is both charming and hugely insightful; reminders of gotchas complement realistic use cases, paced at a comfortable curve. You’ll find when you finish the book that you’ve gained a strong and comprehensive sense of mastery.” —Paul Irish, developer advocate, Google Chrome “This is not a book for those looking for shortcuts; rather it is hard-won experience distilled into a guided tour. It’s one of the few books on JS that I’ll recommend without hesitation.” —Alex Russell, TC39 member, software engineer, Google In order to truly master JavaScript, you need to learn how to work effectively with the language’s flexible, expressive features and how to avoid its pitfalls. No matter how long you’ve been writing JavaScript code, Effective JavaScript will help deepen your understanding of this powerful language, so you can build more predictable, reliable, and maintainable programs. Author David Herman, with his years of experience on Ecma’s JavaScript standardization committee, illuminates the language’s inner workings as never before—helping you take full advantage of JavaScript’s expressiveness. Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you’ll rely on for years to come. Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You’ll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include Better ways to use prototype-based object-oriented programming Subtleties and solutions for working with arrays and dictionary objects Precise and practical explanations of JavaScript’s functions and variable scoping semantics Useful JavaScript programming patterns and idioms, such as options objects and method chaining In-depth guidance on using JavaScript’s unique “run-to-completion” approach to concurrency",

					"TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript with the potential to solve many of the headaches for which JavaScript is famous. But TypeScript has a learning curve of its own, and understanding how to use it effectively can take time. This book guides you through 62 specific ways to improve your use of TypeScript. Author Dan Vanderkam, a principal software engineer at Sidewalk Labs, shows you how to apply these ideas, following the format popularized by Effective C++ and Effective Java (both from Addison-Wesley). You’ll advance from a beginning or intermediate user familiar with the basics to an advanced user who knows how to use the language well. Effective TypeScript is divided into eight chapters: Getting to Know TypeScript TypeScript’s Type System Type Inference Type Design Working with any Types Declarations and @types Writing and Running Your Code Migrating to TypeScript",

					"JavaScript is arguably the most polarizing and misunderstood programming language in the world. Many have attempted to replace it as the language of the Web, but JavaScript has survived, evolved, and thrived. Why did a language created in such hurry succeed where others failed? This guide gives you a rare glimpse into JavaScript from people intimately familiar with it. Chapters contributed by domain experts such as Jacob Thornton, Ariya Hidayat, and Sara Chipps show what they love about their favorite language—whether it’s turning the most feared features into useful tools, or how JavaScript can be used for self-expression.

					'No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don’t fully understand the language. This concise yet in-depth guide takes you inside scope and closures, two core concepts you need to know to become a more efficient and effective JavaScript programmer. You’ll learn how and why they work, and how an understanding of closures can be a powerful part of your development skillset. Like other books in the "You Don’t Know JS" series, Scope and Closures dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can achieve true JavaScript mastery. Learn about scope, a set of rules to help JavaScript engines locate variables in your code Go deeper into nested scope, a series of containers for variables and functions Explore function- and block-based scope, “hoisting”, and the patterns and benefits of scope-based hiding Discover how to use closures for synchronous and asynchronous tasks, including the creation of JavaScript libraries',

				description:
					"Harry Kaplonsky is a veteran of World War II, a survivor of the USS Houston's sinking in the South Pacific, and one of the few men still alive who can recount in detail the one thousand and fifteen days of captivity in the notorious Omori POW prison south of Tokyo. It is there Harry was tortured and beaten and witnessed countless atrocities including the murder of his best friend, Curly. Only problem, Harry can't seem to erase the event from his memories, and he sure can't seem to forgive his captors for the barbaric things which took place during his imprisonment. Now, sixty years later, he's angry and on a mission to sue the Obuchi government for an apology. Since his liberation in August, 1945, Harry's life has been spiraling downward, highlighted by one failed relationship after another, five marriages in total, all marred by battering and cruelty. For Harry the suit is more than a legal means to even the score, it is the last opportunity to lay blame for his own failings. Only days from death, Harry's litigation appears to be lapsing with his demise unless he can convince one of the other four Omori survivors to collaborate in the litigation. Unfortunately, all four despise him and won't enjoin the suit. Furthermore, the U.S. government is siding with the Japanese in hopes of winning trade concessions, and vows to fight Harry to the end. The government's legal team is led by none other than Harry's bastard son, Harold, turning the legal battle into a nasty family affair. All appears to be going adversely against the old veteran. Enter Tinker, an aspiring author in the throws of a literary dry spell. She is searching for the one great story (oddly, a non-fiction piece) to turn her fledgling career around. It is the television interview with Harry by Larry King, however, that motivates her into journeying to Texas for the annual USS Houston survivors' reunion and a shot at the rights to Harry's story. A victim of childhood physical abuse herself, Tinker's past soon becomes intertwined with Harry's, the battering both experienced providing common ground. During the course of the interview, Tinker discovers the dark secrets surrounding Harry and his seeming culpability in the deaths of five crewmates. It is this connection which has created a schism between Harry and the last of the Omori survivors. In the end, Tinker must not only reunite the five Omori brothers, she must also come to terms with her own past and forgive her estranged father.",

					"On February 28, 2008, to great international surprise, the British Ministry of Defense released a statement acknowledging that Prince Harry, son of the late Princess Diana and third in line to the British throne, had secretly been deployed to Afghanistan. Subsequent reports revealed that the prince had killed up to thirty Taliban insurgents in directing at least three air strikes, and that he had helped Gurkha troops repel a ground attack of Taliban insurgents using a machine gun. On February 29, Prince Harry was withdrawn from the country with distinction via a covert SAS deployment. This is the amazing story of the first British royal to serve his country in 25 years and his 10 heroic weeks of combat.",

				description:
					"A “moving memoir of son in search of his father,” recounting the life of a psychologist and pacifist who died climbing New Zealand’s highest peak (Publishers Weekly). On February 1, 1960, Harry Scott, conscientious objector, psychologist, and mountaineer, was killed while climbing Mt. Cook. Thirty-five years later, his son set out to look for him. Funny, moving, and beautifully written, this is the story of a father's absence, told partly through the rich and exciting mix of biography, autobiography, and intellectual and social history. HARRY'S ABSENCE is a passionately argued book about New Zealand, addressing the distinction between nationalism and love of country. Finally, it is a recovery, from death, of reasons for living.",
